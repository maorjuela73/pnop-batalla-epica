Create a detailed and neatly organized pixel art based sprite sheet for a zombie character for a game. 
The total size of the sprite sheet should be 160 pixels in width and 288 pixels in height. 
Each individual frame should measure 32 pixels by 32 pixels. 
Follow the arrangement described as such: 1st row displays a side-view of the zombie in attack mode with 5 frames; 
2nd row presents the side-view of the zombie in motion, consisting of 4 frames; 
3rd row features a side-view of idle zombie in 2 frames. 
4th row portrays a back-view of an attacking zombie in 5 frames; 
5th row depicts a back-view of moving zombie with 4 frames;
6th row shows a back view of an idle zombie in 2 frames. 
Rows 7 to 9 repeat this pattern but offer a front-view of the zombie.
Each frame should carefully place the zombie character in the center, making sure it fits properly within the frame's boundaries.
